## Introduction and Motivation

This document outlines the data cleaning process for a financial market analysis project. The goal is to convert raw financial and economic data into a clean, structured format suitable for analysis. The process includes processing market data, macroeconomic indicators, personal income statistics and government spending information.

## Overview of Methods

The cleaning process involves several key steps and methods:

1.  **Data Organization**
    -   Raw data is stored in `data/raw-data`
    -   Processed data is saved to `data/processed-data`
    -   Each dataset type has specific cleaning requirements
2.  **Key Processing Steps**
    -   Missing value imputation
    -   Date standardization
    -   Technical indicator calculation
    -   Feature engineering
    -   Data validation and quality checks

## Data Types and Processing Requirements

### 1. Macroeconomic Data

-   **Required Variables**: GDP, CPI, Unemployment, FedFundsRate, M2, Umscent
-   **Processing Steps**:
    -   Fill missing values using annual means
    -   Calculate YoY and MoM growth rates
    -   Generate lag variables for key indicators
    -   Filter data from year 2000 onwards

### 2. Market Data Technical Indicators

-   **Required Calculations**:
    -   Moving averages (50-day, 200-day)
    -   RSI (14-day period)
    -   MACD (12-day, 26-day EMAs)
    -   Volatility metrics
    -   Volume indicators
    -   Price momentum indicators

### 3. Personal Income and Saving Data

-   **Key Metrics**:
    -   Personal income
    -   Disposable income
    -   Saving rate
    -   Consumption expenditures
    -   Personal taxes

### 4. Government Spending Data

-   **Components**:
    -   Federal spending
    -   State and local spending
    -   Total government expenditures

## Implementation Requirements

### Data Quality Standards

1.  **Missing Values**
    -   Use forward fill for price data
    -   Apply annual means for economic indicators
    -   Zero-fill for volume data
    -   Default values for technical indicators (e.g., RSI = 50)
2.  **Date Range**
    -   Start date: 2000-11-01
    -   End date: 2024-11-30
    -   Daily frequency for market data
    -   Monthly/quarterly frequency for economic data
3.  **Technical Requirements**
    -   Use pandas for data manipulation
    -   Implement proper error handling
    -   Include data validation checks
    -   Document all cleaning steps

### Code Organization

1.  **Setup**
    -   Define output folders
    -   Import required libraries
    -   Set up error logging
2.  **Functions**
    -   Implement cleaning functions for each data type
    -   Create technical indicator calculations
    -   Build data validation checks
3.  **Output**
    -   Save cleaned data in CSV format
    -   Generate processing logs
    -   Include data quality reports

## Validation and Quality Checks

### Required Checks

1.  **Data Completeness**
    -   Verify all required columns exist
    -   Check date continuity
    -   Validate data ranges
2.  **Data Consistency**
    -   Check for outliers
    -   Verify calculations
    -   Ensure proper data types
3.  **Technical Indicator Validation**
    -   Confirm indicator calculations
    -   Verify lag variables
    -   Validate moving averages

## Output Specifications

### File Structure

```

├── raw-data/
│   ├── macro_series_raw_collection.csv
│   ├── t20100_raw_data.csv
│   ├── t10105_raw_data.csv

    ├── personal_info_cleaned.csv
    ├── Government_Spending_Breakdown.csv
    └── [asset]_cleaned.csv
```

### Cleaned Data Requirements

-   All dates in datetime format
-   No missing values
-   Proper column naming
-   Consistent data types
-   Technical indicators calculated
-   Target variables generated

## Iterative Process Notes

The cleaning process may need to be revisited as:

1.  New data becomes available
2.  Analysis requirements change
3.  Data quality issues are discovered
4.  New features are needed
