## Introduction and Motivation

The data collecting part focuses on collecting comprehensive financial and economic data to analyze market performance and economic indicators. Our goal is to collect data from three main sources: - Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) for macroeconomic indicators - Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) for national accounts data - Yahoo Finance for market performance data

These sources will help us understand the relationship between economic factors and market behavior.

## Overview of Methods

We use three primary methods for data collection:

1.  FRED API Collection:
    -   Fetches macroeconomic indicators (GDP, CPI, Unemployment, etc.)
    -   Retrieves Treasury yield data
    -   Collects monetary policy indicators
2.  BEA API Integration:
    -   Gathers National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) data
    -   Collects personal income and consumption metrics
    -   Obtains government spending information
3.  Yahoo Finance Data Retrieval:
    -   Downloads market index data (S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow Jones)
    -   Collects commodity prices (Gold, Crude Oil)
    -   Processes daily market metrics

## Data Requirements

### Data Formats

Primary focus on tabular data (CSV): - Time series financial data - Economic indicators - Market performance metrics

### Target Variables

1.  Regression Targets:
    -   Asset price returns
    -   Economic growth rates
    -   Inflation metrics
2.  Binary Classification Targets:
    -   Market direction (up/down)
    -   Economic state (expansion/contraction)
    -   Yield curve status (normal/inverted)
3.  Multiclass Classification Targets:
    -   Market conditions (bull/bear/sideways)
    -   Economic phases (growth/stagnation/recession)
    -   Trading volume levels (high/medium/low)

## Implementation Requirements

### Data Sources

1.  FRED API:
    -   API Key required
    -   Multiple series collection
    -   JSON response processing
2.  BEA API:
    -   User authentication
    -   Table-specific requests
    -   Annual data retrieval
3.  Yahoo Finance:
    -   No authentication required
    -   Daily data download
    -   Multiple asset handling

### Data Storage

-   Save raw data to `data/raw-data/`:

    ```         
    data/raw-data/
    ├── macro_series_raw_collection.csv
    ├── t20100_raw_data.csv
    ├── t10105_raw_data.csv
    └── [asset]_raw_a.csv
    ```

-   Maintain data integrity

-   Preserve original format
