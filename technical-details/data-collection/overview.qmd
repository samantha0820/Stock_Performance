# Overview

## Goals

The primary goal of this project is to develop a framework for collecting, integrating, and preprocessing economic and financial data from multiple authoritative sources. By creating a systematic approach to data aggregation, we aim to enable advanced economic research, predictive analysis, and data-driven decision-making.

## Motivation

The complexity of economic analysis is fundamentally constrained by consistency, and integration. Existing approaches to economic data collection often suffer from:

-   Fragmented data sources

-   Inconsistent reporting frequencies

-   Limited cross-source compatibility

## Objectives

Our specific objectives are focused on creating a framework for economic data collection, emphasizing comprehensive aggregation, data quality, research potential, and methodological transparency:

### 1. Comprehensive Data Aggregation

-   Collect diverse economic indicators from multiple authoritative sources
-   Integrate data from key economic and financial platforms:
    -   Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
    -   Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
    -   Yahoo Finance
-   Gather a wide range of economic and market performance metrics, including:
    -   Macroeconomic indicators (GDP, CPI, Unemployment)
    -   Market indices (S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow Jones)
    -   Commodity prices (Gold, Crude Oil)
    -   Treasury yield data

### 2. Data Quality and Consistency

-   Implement data processing techniques to ensure data reliability
-   Address challenges of data integration across different sources
-   Develop methods to:
    -   Handle missing or invalid data points
    -   Convert and standardize data types
    -   Merge datasets from multiple sources
-   Ensure clean, consistent data preparation for further analysis

### 3. Research Enablement

-   Prepare a structured, accessible dataset for economic research
-   Save raw collected data in easily manageable CSV format
-   Create a foundation for potential future analyses, including:
    -   Economic trend identification
    -   Market performance studies
    -   Macroeconomic indicator exploration
-   Provide a flexible dataset that supports various research approaches

### 4. Methodological Transparency

-   Document the entire data collection process comprehensively
-   Provide clear, reproducible code for data retrieval
-   Explain the rationale behind data source selection
-   Ensure other researchers can understand and potentially replicate the data collection methodology

## Significance

Bridge the gap between diverse sources and meaningful economic analysis by transforming raw economic data into valuable research resources. We lay the foundation for subsequent analysis by collecting data, managing data quality, research potential, and monitoring economic dynamics.

## Key Deliverables

-   Comprehensive CSV datasets covering multiple economic indicators

-   Well-documented data collection methodology

-   Clean, standardized economic and market performance data
