# Introduction
## Introduction and Motivation

The goal of this section is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of financial and economic indicators. It help us understand the distributional properties of the variables. This is an important preparation for subsequent modeling.

### **Background**
The datasets used in this analysis include:
- **Crude Oil Prices**
- **Dow Jones Index**
- **Gold Prices**
- **Government Spending**
- **Macro Series** (GDP, CPI, unemployment, and other indicators)

These datasets were preprocessed into clean CSV files for further exploration. The key objectives are:

1. Analyzing the distributional characteristics of numerical variables;
2. Examining correlations between variables;
3. Exploring the relationship between key features and target variables.


## Overview of Methods

### Data Preprocessing
  1. Handled missing values using forward-fill and backward-fill methods.
  2. Removed outliers exceeding a 3-standard deviation threshold.
  3. Standardized numerical features using `StandardScaler` to ensure uniform scaling.

### Visualization Techniques
1. **Univariate Analysis**:  
   - Using histograms and density plots to analyze the distribution of individual variables (e.g., Open, Close, Volume, RSI, MACD).
2. **Bivariate Analysis**:
   - Using box plots and density plots to compare the distribution of variables among target categories
3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Identifying relationships between numerical features using correlation matrices and heat maps.
