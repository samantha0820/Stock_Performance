# Instructions 

## Introduction and Motivation:

This section is to predict financial outcomes and market behavior. The primary focus is on predicting:
1. The future direction of the **Dow Jones Index** (binary classification).
2. The **5-day future return** of the Dow Jones Index (regression).

## Overview of Methods:

### Data Preprocessing
- **Normalization**: Features were standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure consistent scaling.
- **Feature Selection**: Selected key financial indicators (e.g., `Daily_Return_sp500`, `Volatility_sp500`, `MA_50_sp500`) and lagged features (e.g., `Lag1_Return`, `Lag2_Return`).
- **Handling Missing Data**: Missing values were imputed using column means or removed when necessary.
- **Train-Test Split**: Data was split into 80% training and 20% testing subsets.

### Model Selection and Training
#### Binary Classification:
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Objective**: Predict the direction of the Dow Jones Index (`Target_dow_jones`).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Confusion Matrix.

#### Regression:
- **Algorithms**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM.
- **Objective**: Predict the 5-day future return (`Future_Return_5D_dow_jones`).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score.

### Training and Testing Strategy
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robust model evaluation.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Hyperparameters for Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM were optimized to improve performance.
