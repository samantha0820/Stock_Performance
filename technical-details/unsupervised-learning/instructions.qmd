# Introduction
## Introduction and Motivation  

This section explores the application of unsupervised learning techniques on financial and macroeconomic datasets. The objective is to reveal hidden patterns and relationships using methods such as PCA and K-Means clustering.  

### Objectives:  
1. Use **PCA** to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional datasets while preserving key information.  
2. Apply **K-Means clustering** to identify distinct patterns or groupings within the data.  
3. Investigate the relationship between financial market behaviors and macroeconomic indicators.  
4. Detect abnormal behaviors, such as extreme volatility, and analyze their technical and macroeconomic causes.  

## Overview of Methods:

### **Data Preprocessing**
- Combined and cleaned datasets (S&P 500, Crude Oil, Gold, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones).  
- Handled missing values using forward-fill and backward-fill techniques.  
- Removed outliers based on a 3-standard deviation threshold.  
- Standardized data using **StandardScaler**.  

### **Dimensionality Reduction**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** was used to reduce dimensionality to 2 components.  
- Explained variance: PC1 (**56.9%**), PC2 (**23.4%**).  

**Key Outputs**:
- Visualized PCA scatter plot to explore cluster tendencies.  

#### **PCA Principle**
PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional space while retaining as much information as possible about the variance of the data. It works as follows:

1. Normalize the data to ensure that each feature has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.
Calculate the covariance matrix to capture the relationship between features.
2. Perform a feature decomposition of the covariance matrix to find the principal components (i.e., the directions with the highest variance).
3. Project the data onto these principal components to achieve dimensionality reduction.

The end result is a set of uncorrelated principal components that are ordered by the magnitude of the captured variance, thus simplifying the structure of the dataset while preserving its main patterns and information. 

### **Clustering Techniques**
- Applied **K-Means Clustering**:
  - Optimal clusters determined using **Elbow Method** (**k=3**).  
  - Evaluated clusters using the **Silhouette Score** (**0.346**).  
  - Analyzed feature distributions by cluster.  
- Investigated macroeconomic indicators' relationships with market behavior using **correlation analysis** and **Granger causality tests**.  

#### **K-Means Clustering Principle**
K-Means is an iterative clustering algorithm designed to partition a dataset into `k` distinct groups. The process involves:  
1. **Initialization**: Randomly assigning `k` cluster centroids.  
2. **Assignment Step**: Assigning each data point to the closest centroid based on a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance).  
3. **Update Step**: Recomputing centroids as the mean position of all points in a cluster.  
4. Repeating the assignment and update steps until centroids stabilize (convergence).  
The algorithm minimizes within-cluster variance while maximizing between-cluster variance. Key hyperparameters include the number of clusters (`k`) and the initialization method (e.g., `k-means++` for better starting centroids).
